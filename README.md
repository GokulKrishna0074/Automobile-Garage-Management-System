# Automobile Garage Management System

This is a full-stack web application developed to manage automobile garage operations such as service registration, service tracking, billing, and payment status. The project follows a real-world garage workflow instead of a simple CRUD approach.

---

## Overview

In a real garage, service cost and parts cost are not known at the time of vehicle registration. This system is designed to handle that scenario by allowing billing and payment updates only after the service is completed. The user interface dynamically enables or disables actions based on the service state.
